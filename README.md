# Wordcloud Maker

Built using R 3.6.3
All required packages that need to be installed can be found in global.R

The project folder should look like this:

![Directory Structure](directoryStructure.png)

* data
  * frequency.xlsx
  * palettes.xlsx
* www
  * all_palettes.png
  * colorblind_palettes.png
  * r_colors.pdf

Because this Shiny app uses so many packages, publishing a web app of this size on shinyapps.io requires paying a monthly fee, and I'd rather not do that :)
